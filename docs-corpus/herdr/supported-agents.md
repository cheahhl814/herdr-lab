# Supported agents / harnesses in herdr (curated cross-reference)

> CURATED from herdr's own docs (`online-docs-0.8.2/agents.md`, `agent-skill.md`) and the
> verbatim `herdr agent start --help` kind enum (`../harnesses/herdr-supported-kinds.txt`).
> Docs snapshot 0.8.2 vs installed CLI 0.8.0 — re-capture the kind enum if a kind is rejected.

## Re-verification 2026-10-28 (herdr 0.9.0) — the enum moved

The kind enum was re-captured on a 0.9.0 binary (`help-agent-start.md`, `../harnesses/herdr-supported-kinds.txt`,
both regenerated 2026-10-28). The 0.8.0 enum had 21 kinds; **0.9.0 has 23** — `qwen` is now a
real `--kind` (it was docs-only in 0.8.0) and `muse` is new. `muse` has no entry in the 0.8.2
docs snapshot: treat it as undocumented — verify it behaves like a normal harness before
putting it in a fleet.

**Consequence for the skill:** the kind list in this file is a *snapshot of a machine*, not
the live truth. Never copy kinds from here — read the live `--kind` enum
(`herdr agent start --help`) or run the local probe `bin/herdr-capabilities.py`
(SKILL.md §4.6 step 2), which also reports which of these are actually installed here.

## Detection & state rules that affect the skill's workflow

- **Lifecycle-authority agents** (pi, omp, mastracode, kimi, opencode, kilo with
  hooks/plugin installed): hook reports are the sole authority for `idle`/`working`/
  `blocked` — screen-manifest fallback is disabled to avoid two sources of truth.
- **Screen-manifest agents** (claude, codex, copilot, cursor, droid, agy, grok, …):
  state is classified from the live bottom-buffer screen snapshot via TOML manifests.
  Herdr checks herdr.dev for remote manifest updates automatically (disable with
  `[update] manifest_check = false`).
- **Blocked detection is deliberately strict**: only known approval/question/permission
  UI shapes mark `blocked`. Unknown prompts fall back to `idle` labelled
  `default_known_agent_idle_fallback` → **an unlearned prompt can settle as `idle`
  while the agent actually waits for input** — reinforces SKILL.md §2 (never treat a
  settled state as completion without reading output).
- **No-integration agents** (amp, kiro, maki): detection only; no session identity.
- **Gemini CLI and Cline**: detected but "less thoroughly tested" → expect more
  misclassifications; verify output extra carefully when delegating to them.
- **Qwen Code**: listed in docs but absent from the 0.8.0 `--kind` enum — may require a
  newer herdr binary to start via `herdr agent start`. **Resolved on 0.9.0**: `qwen` is now in
  the enum (see the re-verification note above).

## Wrapper / environment gotchas

- Host-visible wrappers hide the real agent process. Set `HERDR_AGENT=<agent>` on the
  wrapper command, e.g. `HERDR_AGENT=claude fence -- claude` (Linux) or
  `HERDR_AGENT=claude nono run --profile claude-code -- claude` (macOS). Applies only
  to that foreground process; do NOT export globally.
- Local detection overrides: `~/.config/herdr/agent-detection/<agent>.toml` (local wins
  over remote/bundled; invalid files are ignored with a warning).
- Debug detection with `herdr agent explain --file screen.txt --agent codex --json`.
- Install integration hooks: `herdr integration install claude` (per-agent; gives
  lifecycle authority + session identity).
